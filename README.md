# Text Vectorization

Applying text vectorization in databases using Word Embedding model in Python. This project was made as final project for **SME0142 - Linear Algebra and Applications** class as a method of study about mapping words in text to vectors in a finite real vector space. 

All the needed information, documentation and the main pipeline can be found into the python notebook file, together with the references we've used.
