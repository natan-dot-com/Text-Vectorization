       " \"Out of all the reviews I wrote This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!\",\n",
       " \"Disclaimer I survivor main. I play games for fun not for competition so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops) and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with) then no biggie. Next game please I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one) I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up there is always the next game )That being said this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it have fun with it and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!) and even then recognize that there are jerks who play this game like any other game and have fun while you compete!\",\n",
       " 'ENGLISH After playing for more than two years I am given the task of reviewing this game again.This review will be as complete as possible so if you do not want to see the full review I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as Pallets Windows 360\\'s Moonwalks Hide Different powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.Rating Balance 6/10 Mechanical system 9/10 Innovation 8/10 Gameplay 8/10Graphics It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect. Animation 6/10 Optimization 5/10 Graphics 6/10 Matchmaking In this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but it\\'s still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1. Servers 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusion This game has great potential for anyone who likes the \"Slasher\" or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors. That potential is covered up by big bugs. Gameplay 8/10 Graphs 6/10 Innovation 8/10 Fun 9/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Rating final 7.4/10 Although this game has many errors I recommend this game.Sorry for my english.

Esta reseña estará compuesta por 4 apartados y algunos sub apartados. Gameplay Este juego consiste en que hay 4 superviviente y un asesino que deben completar una serie de objetivos en un mapa. Los supervivientes debe escapar del asesino reparando 5 generadores y abriendo unas puertas. Por su parte los asesinos debe perseguir colgar sacrificar o matar a los supervivientes.Los supervivientes y asesinos tienen la posibilidad de usar habilidades objetos accesorios y ofrendas que ayudan a dar ventaja dentro de una partida.Ofrece un buen mecánicas para escapar del asesino o atrapar al superviviente como Pallets Ventanas 360\\'s Moonwalks Esconderse Poderes diferentes en cada killerEl balanceo es uno de los aspectos mas difíciles del juegos. En cada actualizacion se cambia el balanceo haciendo nerf o buff a los killer y supervivientes. En mi opinion hay muchas cosas donde el balanceo esta bien. pero hay muchas otras cosas que fallan mucho.Rating Balanceo 6/10 Mecánicas 9/10 Innovación 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Gráficos Usa el motor gráfico Unreal Engine 4 lo que es un motor con bastante buena iluminación y fácil de usar con respecto a otros motores. En el apartado gráfico optimización y animación de Dead by Daylight es mediocre por que hay bastantes bugs gráficos o animación pero se debe entender que que Behaviour no es Epic game para poder invertir tanto dinero en ese aspecto. Animación 6/10 Optimización 5/10 Gráficos 6/10 Matchmaking En este aspecto el juego ha mejorado bastante estos 2 años pero sigue siendo bastante mediocre Hay bastantes bugs en buscar killers y supervientes. Lo peor es que el host sea el killer y no haya servers. Y aparte falla mucho el sistema de rank hay partidas que te pueden tocar rangos 20 siendo rango 1. Servidores 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusión Este juego tiene un gran potencial para todo aquel que le guste el \"Slasher\" o que quiere pasar buenas noches con amigos o matando y haciendo enojar a supervivientes. Ese potencial se ve tapado por grandes bugs.

       " \"Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside I enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing and so I will recommend.\",\n",

       " 'This is simultaneously the most fun and most infuriating game I\\'ve played in a long time.It\\'s an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.For an asymmetrical game it\\'s in a state where it\\'s surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains for instance must hate themselves to play that and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.New content is regular 1 killer 1 survivor 3 perks for each side and a map are released every 3 months or so mid chapter balance patches occur and cosmetics are regularly added.There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly they won\\'t do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a \\'meh\\' stage he sits in boring weak and generally unfun.Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you unless they are picked on the \"random\" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this despite in game currency being used for cosmetics anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It\\'s a move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.Awesome and incredibly angry community as you\\'d expect from a game like this.',\n",

Where killing requires significantly more concentration survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles and the killers have completely different \"powers\" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It\\'s a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play.

       " \"Dead by Daylight is a very interesting game. Bringing us into the land of Slasher horror films. Something not a lot of games venture into if at all.You can play as a Slasher or a Survivor. Survivors have a third person perspective and have audio cues to know if the Slasher is close but not its exact position. A small red light on the ground shows the Killer's vision letting you know the Killer is RIGHT behind you when you're being chased if you even DARE to look back. When you're being chased the Slasher is slightly faster. But this is balanced out with ways to avoid the killer. Throwing down pallets to block him while you run off in tall grass or hide in a closet or something. Your objective is to activate 5 generators with 3 other survivors and then escape. Sounds simple but it's a lot harder than it sounds. There is no voice chat in ranked matches so plans cannot be made.There are three Slashers each with different abilities. You have the Trapper who uses Bear Traps to trap survivors in choke points during chases or stop them getting to the generators from helping survivors etc. The Wraith who has a cloaking ability. Many users are complaining that this slasher is Overpowered. The cloaking prevents survivors from hearing the audio cue that plays when the Slasher is near. However before the Wraith can go invisible a bell toll plays announcing that he's cloaking. Players then have the option of continuing what they're doing or be more careful.Then you have the Hillbilly that has a Chainsaw dash ability able to cut down a survivor in one fell swoop.All three of the Slashers have a melee weapon that takes down a survivor in two hits. One makes them bleed two downs them to a crawl. When slashing there's a slight cooldown for when you hit a survivor. When you hit a survivor the Slasher wipes the blood onto his sleeve and he slows down for a few seconds allowing the Survivor to get a headstart. Fair trade in my opineon. If the slasher was able to do two swings in rapid succession it wouldn't be very fair.The goal of the Slasher no matter the type is to either kill or sacrifice all the Survivors by putting them on meat hooks. Once again this is harder than it sounds. Survivors can help eachother getting others off meathooks healing eachother helping repair the Generators etc.The game has one core gameplay mode but two ways to do it. Ranked is as simple as it sounds. Play as a Slasher or Survivor against random online people. Or you can do Kill Your Friends mode which is the same but in a private match for at least 2 people(One person HAS to be the Slasher). Now the big difference between the two. In ranked mode you score blood points which you can use to upgrade your character. Give them new perks and items to use. However in Kill Your Friends this stuff is blocked. I'm guessing this is mainly to stop people from farming points. If this is something that bothers you you might not want to spend money on this. Be warned.Speaking of points. There is a character customization point or loadout. Which allows you to add items to your character.(As stated above) There's not many choices of clothing and cosmetics as of yet. This is likely to be added in future updates along with new play modes.Maps are of relatively medium to large size all of which are dark and forboding and are procedurally generated. Generators in a place you might know now will be switched in different plays.I think this game is quite fun and is a pretty good horror game that will make you tense up.Price is pretty damn low for something of this kind of quality only $20. Ten dollars more if you want the Deluxe edition.Go ahead and get this game if you wish and enjoy yourself you masochistic maniac you.\",\n",

But i can still tolerate it because if you actually know when to play it doesn't take time that long. But the real prob is everytime this game releases a new patch and you update the game it becomes worse for no reason. On the first patch my fps dropped from 40 50 to around 20 30 and after i updated the latest patch(today's patch). The game becomes literally unplayable. i can't even get into the main menu. the game tells me to verify the game but it fixes nothing.

Controls are simple and easy to learn. Gameplay (when the game works as intended) is fun for the killer and intense and scary for the survivors.Negatives Current gameplay is buggy at times. The game should have remained in early access for a few more weeks. There is no Looking for Group option at this time. You can either queue for randoms and click back and re queue until you find your friends or you can play a game with your friends but without a full party (unless you have the friends to create a full party). I definitely recommend this game to people but anyone playing should expect bugs ranging from funny (survivors floating through the air instead of running) to game breaking (survivors stuck in trees after being saved from the hook).

The killers have this nice familiar but original feel to them. Map design is IN my opinion great! the perks and addons for each character cand really help you out at times! Cons! Rarely you are randomly kicked out of a match with no reason told Nurse is just annoying not really a bad con (It can be avoided easily if your a regular to dodging the hunnies) it would actually be cool to have some seperate lobby music. something similar to what it is now. but i like the song so much i dont want to hear it over and over again and get bored. (but it does have a very long runtime and has awesome sounding parts so its not just an annoying short loop. The game is a very fun game to me and i dont think it deserves all this hate!sure the matchmaking connectivity can be a little annoying. but its just because its free weekend currently. and its pairing you with squads of survivors who can be people in 3s looking for 1 more person or a squad of 2 looking for 2 more. just a player group complaint and i cant say thats a bad game bug or design. its mostly player complaint.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME WITH ALL MY HEART',\n",

I enjoy the concept and love the games design but further editing to the killers functions needs to be a neccessity and survivor teamwork needs to be buffed. My recomendation would be to add in a stamina meter for both the surviors and killers. This would mean that vaulting and putting down barricades wears down your stamina than just sincerely running away from the killer. The killer holding onto survivors will slow down when holding onto to them and will have to plan out attacks as stamina recovery for killers for each kill goes down each time.

       " 'UPDATED REVIEW I wrote the bulk of this back in February \\'17 and things have changed since then. Check the bottom for the updated parts. If you read through the negative reviews for Dead by Daylight you\\'ll generally find two things genuine complaints about the bugs and people who simply aren\\'t good at the game talking about how this Killer or that Survivor perk is \"broken\" or \"nerfed.\"Let\\'s be real for a moment Lots and I mean lots of people are just bad at this game. You\\'ll see them trust me. They either can\\'t learn to work as a part of a team (or can\\'t find others who try which is only a real problem at the lower ranks with all the other newbies) or they don\\'t have the stuff to take down a team on their own. So to start don\\'t pay attention to these particular complaints. They are made by people who as the kids say suck at either specific aspects of the game or the game as a whole.CONS Now on to credible cons. The bugs too often render the game unplayable. I\\'m looking at you loading screen bug. If you\\'re like me and used to playing buggy games this will be tolerable for you I mean having to exit the game several times and reboot it is by no means an issue to people who make a habit of playing games in their alphas we\\'re almost surprised when we *don\\'t* ever have to relaunch a game. If you don\\'t like the waiting you may struggle with this and that would be a valid reason to avoid Dead by Daylight. Until such a time as the developers finally fix this issue (among others of course) I expect and encourage a lot of complaining about the loading screen bug.Sometimes you\\'ll get put in a lobby with someone either way above or way below your rank. It happens. You\\'ll get butchered by a rank 4 Killer (who isn\\'t really enjoying it either mind you you\\'re too easy) and you\\'ll make a far too easy getaway from a rank 19 Killer who hasn\\'t yet learned how to look in the bushes. This is frustrating for everyone in the lobby and you\\'ll probably catch some flak for it if you were the one misplaced the Survivors in particular (usually ranks 15 10 the ones who have gotten good at the game and are still in their angsty phase of play where they think everyone else sucks and should be told so) can be a salty bunch.More often than you\\'ll probably like you\\'ll get put in a lobby with an Old McDonald\\'s WiFi Killer and you\\'ll lag badly enough that you\\'ll either die because of it or be disconnected entirely. Yeah it\\'s frustrating but that happens in any multiplayer game hosted by one of the players. Somehow people seem to attribute this flaw to Dead by Daylight in particular which is absurd. That being said dedicated servers should they ever become available for the game would be fantastic and that\\'s the half of this complaint that is completely valid.PROS Now that we\\'ve addressed the major cons of the game let\\'s look at some of the pros. The way the leveling system works at its core is that you gain points and ranks based on how many points you scored in a match. There\\'s four ways for Survivors and four ways for Killers to get these points. That on its own is a fairly basic and simple system. The part of this system that makes the game great is *what* those ways to get points are. For example as a Survivor you gain points towards leveling by assisting saving or even just being near your fellow Survivors. You make progress in the game by helping each other a seamlessly introduced method of encouraging players to stick together. As a Killer you get points from using your chosen Killer\\'s special power (chainsaw short range teleporting etc.) meaning that you\\'re inherently going to level up as certain Killers better than others you do in fact make a special kind of progress by playing to your strengths. Speaking of leveling while your rank is static across all the different Survivors and all the different Killers each specific member of each group is counted and leveled individually. This means that most of the time a Jake Park player is a Jake Park player that\\'s who you\\'re good at that\\'s who you play. It leaves room for diversity among players because it\\'s not as simple as \"this one does more damage so naturally everyone plays him.\" There\\'s no one Survivor or Killer that\\'s better than the next they\\'re all unique in some way and they all play to different types of players\\' styles and tastes.Finally as a horror game enthusiast when I initially played Dead by Daylight I found that the fear that accompanies hiding from a monster that isn\\'t an AI that is in fact another person was far more satisfying than waiting for the programmed beastie to finish its programmed patrol and move on when I knew it was safe. You can\\'t predict a Killer as easily as that because it\\'s not nearly as easy to know what they\\'re doing. Are they really gone or did they take a few steps away to wait for you to come out? Is he revving up that chainsaw because he actually did see you or is he just trying to scare you out of hiding? Do you stay or do you go? As I played on of course this fear eventually left me. But it didn\\'t fade away it transformed into strategy. I\\'m not playing a game trying to figure out the patterns of the AI monster I\\'m trying to either outsmart and outrun or outsmart and run down another person. This dynamic may not be as prevelant at the lower ranks which is natural given that at lower ranks players simply aren\\'t as experienced but should you stick to the game long enough you\\'ll find a unique kind of game that you\\'re going to love just as much at rank 1 as you did at rank 20 if you\\'re anything like me. tl dr If you can\\'t handle bugs waiting and lag this game probably isn\\'t for you. If you\\'re prone to outrage when someone\\'s better at a game than you this game probably isn\\'t for you. If you can appreciate strategy skill and teamwork this game is for you. 8/10 do recommend.UPDATE Dead by Daylight is an ever growing ever changing game. And it\\'s changed a lot since I started playing and since I wrote this review. Lots of new killers and survivors new maps new perks updates to the way things used to work... I won\\'t get into specifics but one thing you can definitely count on is that this game is not a stagnant one. It\\'s still evolving and it\\'s still improving. The community however has overall gotten much saltier since last writing. That\\'s something that can\\'t really be helped by the developers or by other players it just is. All of this being said I\\'ve found that the longer one plays Dead by Daylight the *more* hooked one becomes. It\\'s not a game where playing for the first 100 hours is the highlight and it fades from attention after that. In fact you don\\'t even really begin to understand the game until you\\'re much further in. At 171 hours I know enough to stay alive and kill people a lot more efficiently than I used to but I\\'m still a rookie compared to some of the people that play this game with 500 1 000 3 000 hours logged. If you\\'re looking for a game that\\'ll stick with you as long as you stick with it this is the place to be.Score remains at 8/10.',\n",

       " \"Part 4 Another post update review. I'd once again like to commend the developers for being total . Instead of working on matchingmaking services like any sane game designer would do they decided it was more important to release another killer and provide useless scaling patches in order to undo the damages that they did with the previous ones. Only in Dead by would a person decide that having your users play a ready up simulator for 45 minutes prior to getting a game with friends is a praise worthy event. Part 3 Re updating my review again. I'd like to add that after multiple updates the match making system is worse than ever. Not only is it nearly impossible to get into a match but when you do you get put against the who have been playing this game since its conception. If sitting around for 30 minutes without a game trying to queue with your friends prior to getting skull ed is for you buy this game.Part 2 Improving my review from to mediocre. The group matchmaking now actually works in the sense that if you wish to be placed against people that consistantly butt you without any type of lube. Thanks for placing a new player against chodes that have been playing the beta for more cumulative time than they've seen any woman except for their mother.\",\n",

It will show the killer where s/he is thanks to one perk.A survivor is far from a hooked mate? Her/his position will be known by the killer.If you decide to run as a survivor which you most of the time can\\'t avoid to do jokes on you the killer can follow you without having you in sight.If the killer gets you s/he can easily reach one of the multiple hooks available all around the map making it impossible for the survivor to use the spam \"A D\" dodge mechanic.Good to know as well most of the time if you get hooked by a killer be prepared to get face camped until you die. It\\'s not a problem for her/him since at the end of the game s/he will get more bloodpoints (in game currency) than the \"best\" survivor even killing just 1 out of 4.

But given the chance it's really not what one thinks.It's more than the standard type of horror game. It plays with the mind stimulating the fear if you're a victim and stimulating the psychopathic killer in all of us when playing as the killer.I'm still not sure which part of the game I enjoy more being the killer or being the victim. Pros It has a uniqueness about it I've not seen in any other game. Ever.I like the fact it has a first person view when you're the killer and a third person view when you're a victim.Both aspects have a completely different way of playing and both aspects are completely fun.Cons I've noticed a few glitches within the game. Each one was from a victim standpoint.Fixing the generator and killer clubs me and picks me up we both get stuck at the generator and even with another victim coming back to help me still couldn't help me.Another was being bashed to the ground to the point of crawling away victims came to heal me but couldn't and killer couldn't pick me up to put me on hook ...First time as a victim was on hook someone helped me off and I was wedged in the beam that supports the hook and couldn't get out at first.

       " 'I feel like it is time for me to review this game. This review will explain the premise of the game and what game play consists of!OverviewDead by Daylight is a 4vs1 horror game where one player is a killer and the other four are survivors. The killer cannot be killed so the survivors have to work together to stay hidden and finish five generators which will power the exit gates so that they can then escape. The killer has to hit the survivors twice to down them and then hook them on meat hooks where they can then be saved by other survivors.GameplaySurvivorAlmost every action is further progressed by doing skill checks for example when you are repairing a generator or healing at random points a circle will come up where you have to press space bar in a certain area to complete a successful skill check these can be a bit difficult at first but are easy to learn with practice.Actions will still progress even without skill checks but skill checks provide a quick small addition to the progress of the action though failing a skill check will slightly regress the actions progress!Perks items and addons are all gained through the bloodweb a sort of spider web where you can spend bloodpoints earnt in game every time you complete a bloodweb you will level up this goes on to a maximum of level 50 where you can either prestige or continue levelling to gain items perks and addons. The absolute maximum level is prestige 3 level 50.All survivors move at the same speed though perks certain perks affect some movement speeds a running survivor with no movement boosts speed is considered 100%. Survivor sizes differ with (from my experience) Claudette being the smallest and Bill being the largest. Every survivor has 3 unique perks that are unlocked at levels 5 10 and 15 and then become teachable (availible to all characters) at level 30 35 and 40. KillerAll killers have a unique ability which cannot be taught to other killers though same as survivors their perks can they also have the same perks unlock levels max level and prestige system as survivors.Killers do not have to complete any skill checks to progress actions.Killers also level up through the bloodweb in the same way as survivors and gain perks item and addons from this.Killers do move at different speeds with The Nurse being the slowest at 96% speed and The Trapper Hillbilly Wraith and Shape (Tier 2 3) being the joint fastest at 115% speed. These are the walking movement speeds not including things such as invisibility as the wraith or chainsaw sprint as the Hillbilly and are not including any movement buff perks or addons.RanksThere are 20 ranks which go from 20 (the worst) to 1 (the best) killers and survivor ranks do not affect each other for example if you lose a survivor game your killer rank will be unaffected and vice versa.Each rank has a certain amount of pips inside it (the lower rank have 3 mid have 4 and high have 5) ProsInteresting and addictive gameplay with a wide variety of killers survivors maps playstyles.Every game feels unique and fun you will always be on your toes ready to either pounce as the killer or feeling dread as you know the killer could be round every corner as a survivor.Has a ranking system which gives you a rough indication of how good a player you are.Killing survivors is extremely satisfying!Although the game is a bit of a grind it is definitely not boring to improve and level up.Games usually feel relatively fair.ConsPeer to peer system instead of servers (based off the killers connection) means that as a survivor if the killer has bad connection it can be a very frustrating experience!Some minor bugs which can occasionally be frustrating.DLCIMPORTANT Even if you do not own any of the dlc you can still play against dlc killers and with dlc survivors you can also play on all the dlc maps and see any dlc items.There are currently 2 free dlc addons to the game and 3 paid ones all the dlc are fairly priced and each adds one new survivor and killer to play and a new map for all to play.None of the DLC add an overpowered killer or survivor so you do not feel at a disadvantage if you do not own them.There are also a few survivor and killer cosmetic packs.SummaryAll scoring is out of 10 Graphics 8 Art Style 8 Customisation 7.5 Gameplay 9.5 Music/Sound 8.5 Overall 8.5 If you find any incorrect information spelling mistakes typos etc please inform me!If you found this helpful please up rate it as it took me a long time to write!',\n",

The graphics are nicely done with absolutely gorgeous or goregeous characters in it and astonishing maps to play on. With every new chapter that's getting released it becomes a little more interesting since this is not just a plain survival game but also has a lot of varities thinking of the many different killers that can be played. Since it is an online game it doesn't get boring over time even though it's always the same goals to reach yet it's a great place to meet people to play with.The Dead by Daylight community is welcoming sometimes full of male sex organs and sandbaggers but also full of fun people. And what do you do when you get sandbagged? Just do the same fluffin' thing and learn how to juke or tell the others your opinion in the chat after the game results are shown! Everyone loves nice criticism.But in all reality I really enjoy this game and am not going to stop playing it any time soon. I am fascinated by the design sound and ideas the developers come up with in every patch or chapter.

There are also usable and passive items to help you each match.

U dont even feel this hours of gameplay. The best is ubdates and conntent really often but some patches are totally ts. And ye survivors are strong but balance team have no idea what to do with that. So they nerf everythink and checked how this gonna work. Bugs are problematic but meh gameplay is anyway good. I can reccomend that but u need to collect team because survive with friends is the best what game can offer to you. Really thats the best part of this game.

When i have break or play survi not killer i get 17 16 rank im just winning 20 matches in row with 4 kills its boooooring sometimes. And unfair to survivors how people with 1 300 hours can play vs guy who have 900 hours and got another acc with 900 hours ? There should be some tiers like diamond tier platinium tier or whatever u named it and there should be ranks idk from 10 to 1. And reset is hmm 3 4 mouths not every mounth. That would make some balance in matchmaking. Other problem is servers orrr host servers with 130 150 ping its totally normal ping thats really funny to watch when killer got 300 400 but game priority is killer so in his screen u can be near him and he hit you but if u are idk 5 10 m from him u anyway get hitted. Dedicates servers are really needed.

       " 'It\\'s really not a coincidence that more and more people are leaving the game and its pretty sad. Killers are at a \"balanced\" state among Rank 20\\'s. Where even if they are bad at the game and are completely new to the game they can at least 3k in a game against other rank 20\\'s. Now this is fine until you consider Rank 1 game play. Because killers have been slowly buffed over time and already skilled killers are getting the buffs it is really difficult to win a game as survivor. The 2 000 hours I have playing survivor doesn\\'t change that. Get to a pallet and get hit with broken hit boxes with (enduring/spirit fury/both). Run for a window (bamboozle). Oh and by the way no more pallets or windows over here so might as well 360 (auto aim with M1). If that somehow works and I manage to anger the killer in any way shape or form then they will (lag switch/camp/tunnel/all of the above). It\\'s actually insane how far killers have gone in terms of power since 1.4 which was a time when survivors legitimately needed nerfs and now. And honestly like around 1.9 they finally had some balance between the 2 sides. However the devs were still on the nerf train to accommodate Rank 20\\'s. This should have ended at 1.9 and instead should have been reworking the lower tier killers to be better because it was balanced at Rank 1. This is a time when survivors weren\\'t op and skilled killers that got 4k\\'s deserved them. But no the devs don\\'t care about the current player base they only care about new people coming in to start playing. It\\'s to the point where if you have any playtime over 100 hours then you can consistently 4k with ease. It really doesn\\'t help that they manage to break the game more then they fix it with every update. The one thing they actually need to change is to (buff survivors/nerf killers) and nerf gen speed or add a 2nd objective because that is the only way to have a chance at beating a killer is with the power of gen rush. If this would happen then the objective would take a little longer but survivors would be stronger so that if you are actually skilled at survivor then you have more of a chance to survive in a chase instead of the incredibly boring 20 second chases that the devs insist they want for the game. It wore fun for killer and survivor in my opinion especially without having the stress of all the gens being done in 3 minutes even with ruin. I say this just because holding M1 and pressing space occasionally is more boring then being chased. Adding a fair and not incredibly tedious 2nd objective then it would spice the game up and give time where you could potentially be chased in. Will this happen? Probably not.

At least come up with a system where the killers lose points if they camp. It makes the gameplay a lot less entertaining when you're being camped 95% of the time. And sadly that's around the right percentage of camper killers. I come across them in almost every game.Here's another problem the killer is way too fast. Maybe slow him down a bit? Also fix the glitch where he can hit you through windows. I've gotten caught countless times this way.

       " \"Updated 29/8/16Note I've stopped updating this guide because the developers haven't made a decent patch yet.It s now been a handful of months since the release date of DBD and when I made my first review of this game.It s gotten marginally better but overall little has changed.1) MatchmakingMatchmaking is looking worse every update. Each patch the developers seem to break or cripple matchmaking times for a day or two before fixing it. Furthermore there is still no evidence of a calculation done for players when they match make meaning a totally new player can get matched to a very experienced set of player(s) that will make short work of them as a new player.An example from a match I just had http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 752856827Lots of new players find this very frustrating to be outmatched and outgunned so heavily. And from an experienced player side it makes games very boring and grinding.And yes the game is still P2P hosted so the killer has a big network advantage on you if he decides to plug his 200m Ethernet cable into their neighbour s modem. That is all assuming that you actually find a match. I ve been waiting in lobbies for 20 minutes with over 18K people online.2) BalanceIn terms of matchmaking little is being done about the overall balance of gameplay and how each side reacts to each other s decisions. There is still a lack of a push or pull mechanic meaning that games are over very quickly or very slowly depending on who has the better perks.The developers seem to favour the killer over the survivors every update the killer gets noticeable buffs while the survivors get nerfs or nothing at all. Last update the killer even got an auto aim feature for the lunge attack meaning you could lunge at a survivor as they turned a corner and majestically ballroom dance your way round the corner while lunging to hit them. This makes games very unfair for the survivor.There are maps themed around each killer the problem is that some killers are very useless on specific maps maps you have very little control over playing. This leads to very biased games which can be a stomp or very frustrating.3) ProgressionProgression is getting more and more tiresome each update. The progression tree is randomly generated which means you can get very lucky and get one of the most overpowered perks in the game early or get completely screwing and get one of the many broken or dysfunctional perks that still aren t fixed.If you love grinding games DBD is very much for you. Your rank will be reset every month as standard and the skill tree is full of clutter and fluff to bulk out levelling. You will get 1 perk per level on your tree but the rest of your tree will be add ons and other consumables that will buff you. The problem is you lose these after every game so the skill tree is flooded with useless consumables you need to buy before you get to your perk or more useful items.This means you could spend almost triple the value of the perk you want just buying the 3 or 4 add ons to get there. This would be fine if the add ons were useful. But many are not.Firstly the descriptions of the items are frustratingly vague. Slightly increases the chance of being sent to Autohaven wreckers when used Well what is this slightly you speak of? Is that 1%? 10%? 40%? More? Less?You can possibly find these figures on the wiki (if they are correct) but if they are on the wiki is it really so hard to put them into the item description? The answer is no it isn t . It is just lazy not to do so.Furthermore the value of perks seems to be all over the place.For this example let s say perk A is worth 3000 points it sits right at the start of the skill web.But then slightly further out you see exactly the same perk but it s worth 5000 points this time.What gives? It just seems like a ploy to get you to throw away more of your hard earned points to string out the progression more. The game lacks so much content at the moment that makes progression tedious in order to make the illusion that it s much more than what it is.4) Overall qualityThe main cause of all these problems is mainly the developer s choices. Update notes are very unhelpful containing phrases as vague as the add on descriptions. Adjusted the catch up speed for the Nurse no reference to what this means just a single sentence that really isn t helpful. There are plenty of other examples where the update notes are just increased or decreased . If the developers are trying to make this game some sort of e spot like they so badly are they really need to put more effort into their update notes.And yet game breaking bugs like getting stuck in objects will still get youhttp //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 752822872The developers also have a habit of addressing the symptoms of a problem and not the disease often completely missing the problem people have been complaining about and change something related to it instead. Like the way map exploits created safe zones for survivors so the developers made the killer s lunge much longer and let the non abusers have a miserable time trying to escape an impossibly long lunge rather than just boarding up the exploits or changing map design.Another example is how they nerfed many of the reward values for performing actions then they threaten players that farm points with permament bans. Even though in some games players get barely enough to rank up due to the nerfs.This game also has an anticheat but it commonly bans people for no reason and still allows cheaters into games.Conclusion This game should really still be in early access.The developers clearly have no idea what they are doing the game is progressively getting worse and more and more people are not playing each month. It has barely improved but has a very long way to go before it will be playable.By the time it gets to be playable the community will be so small that matchmaking times will be long enough to make people quit. Proof of decline http //steamcharts.com/app/381210Friday the 13th is on the horizon and that will most likely blow this show out of the water.The community is also pretty unbearable and technical support is borderline non existant and the forum page for it is a graveyard of bugs going back to the beta that are still not solved.Save your money and avoid.\",\n",
       " 'Dead By Daylight is the ultimate horror themed online multiplayer game. The killers ooze with personality while the survivors not so much but I\\'ll go through the important things about the game.*In case you are wondering \"Why only 1.4 hours in a multiplayer game?\" The answer is because ultimately I refunded it. It\\'s a good game just wasn\\'t for me.*The graphics are meh running the game in ultra settings I found the killers\\' models shine in the game everything else looks bland in comparison but the devs may have made it this way to highlight the killers. Maybe also so that anyone could run the game (not sure what engine it runs on but at least you\\'ll know that lag will be a bigger concern than optimization).Sounds is amazing everything from the brushing through the cornfields rambling of the chainsaws footsteps and other effects create the atmosphere for this brutal af multuplayer game! The music is also on point.The gameplay is what you\\'d expect from a match based multiplayer game which has its rankings reset literally every month. It can be pretty chaotic and/or unbalanced. The game has events every so often which rewards players with cosmetics so that means there is alot of \"farming\" here where players can cheat the system.The game is focused on match ups and not so much skill so if you\\'re a new player expect to grind grind GRIND before you git gud. After all you\\'re going to need all the perks to be unlocked before you do well against people who actually know what they\\'re doing. You will not win on skill alone just hope you picked the right perks to help assist your win.So I thought to myself should I be a part of this community when I don\\'t have the time to put in hundreds or thousands of hours? I slept on it and refunded it as soon as I woke because I have a belief in which if I can\\'t be 100% committed and excited about a mp game then I shouldn\\'t be a part of its player base. I don\\'t have the time or energy to put in even a hundred hours in one game so my answer was clear in the final moments.If you are a horror buff or a multiplayer gamer you should get this at least try it. I enjoyed the little I played but my heart wasn\\'t in it. Doesn\\'t change that the game is a great one for the hardcore mp community though. I thought I\\'d respect the player base and devs enough to write a positive review.',\n",

Newly released DLC comes with newly released bugs. Old bugs still persist!.It\\'s amazing that these guys can call themselves devs yet have no clue about the engine they\\'re working with. I used to love the game despite the bugs but they\\'re ruining the experience a lot and often. Private games is super fun!! No toxicity all fun and games even despite the bugs. Public games are toxic as hell. Survivors will exploit any way they can (They gotta get away no?). Killers will facecamp you if they got emotionally mad in a game meant to be fun maybe even by just blinding them once. I fear for the games future as the DLCs roll out halffinished absolutely not balanced and at a price one can only laugh at as it\\'s far too expensive for what you get. Nevertheless i choose to buy them to gain access to the characters no hard feelings there. The issues with the DLCs in my opinion is the amount of bugs they bring (and amount of bugs they revive).I tried the new killer even before he got buffed. No perks no items no addons. Easy 20 25k points each round. As survivor i get an average of 16 17k pr. game some better than others. TLDR If you play the game go killer it\\'s easy as f Still buggy probably always will beToxic community (on both \"sides\")Exploiting behaviour at any given chance (on both \"sides\") Older reviews and editsEdit August 19th 2016Developers \"tried\" to balance stuff while bringing in a Free DLC and Free weekend to counter negative reviews.

LONG way inbetween the fixes of bugs.Might change this review in the future but after almost 2 months (plus the beta) i doubt it. *hides noisily in closet but bugs out*',\n",

       " 'What you are about to read could be considered biased but I guess that\\'s based on how you interpret it.I really like Dead by Daylight. The game in itself is very likeable. The Survivor playstyle can be very tense and stressful at times based on whether or not you have a good team and whether or not the Killer is good. While the Killer is something I\\'d play if I want a relaxing game as I don\\'t really mind whether I win or lose. It totally isn\\'t because I want to satisfy some of my more inhumane desires or anything like that.Anyway I know people don\\'t consider buying this game because they believe the players are really toxic. Well isn\\'t that just a given with online multiplayer Video Games? I mean in every online multiplayer game I\\'ve played there has always been a toxic personality of sorts. While you may not consider yourself toxic you won\\'t really know until either someone points it out or you go back and look at how you reacted. Another reason people don\\'t consider buying Dead by Daylight is because they believe it\\'s filled to the brim with glitches. Now I can\\'t really prove that considering I haven\\'t really experienced any as far as I know anyway. Isn\\'t that saying something though? While the glitches exist they really aren\\'t as common as people imagine them to be. And again glitches exist in all games some just more common than others.But you know what people are really forgetting? The fact that Behaviour Interactive started with around 30 40 people working on Dead by Daylight and have around 70 80 people now. This is based of the information we got from the video \"This is only the beginning.\" And since Behaviour Interactive is working on Deathgarden who knows if the 70 80 people value is the amount of employees currently working for Behaviour Interactive or the amount of people within Behaviour Interactive that are dedicated to working on Dead by Daylight. And if you were willing to go further then that based on the title of the video mentioned earlier just assume that the last year or so that Dead by Daylight has been out we were just playing an Early Access version of the game.So cut Behaviour Interactive some slack. They started out small and were still able to produce a wonderful game. If you think they aren\\'t working hard enough remember they are still considered a small developer company when compared to other companies that have produced a game just as successful if not more than Dead by Daylight. And they\\'re also working on another game right now that game being Deathgarden which I mentioned earlier. If anything it isn\\'t Behaviour Interactive destroying the game or it\\'s reputation it\\'s the players.Let\\'s end on a good note shall we? Here are two jokes about Dead by Daylight I really like \"I think we did a pretty good job so far.\"\"Behaviour Interactive! There\\'s a game in your bug!\"P.S. I probably won\\'t read any comments you post. Sorry. It\\'s more because everyone has opinions and someone will probably have one against mine. It\\'s one of the main reasons I stated that the review could be considered biased. If you do write something rude/mean about me just so you know I pity you. How come? I feel sorry that you can\\'t say anything nice to someone or learn to keep your mouth shut if you believe what you say might hurt the other person/parties feelings. And if you believe you can say anything over the internet without fear of repercussion I pity you even more.EDIT Disabling comments just because I can. Tired of Killer mains complaining.

       " \"This game Dead by Daylight is quite a fun game. Actually when I bought this game I really had alot of fun playing it. At the time a bought this game (14 months ago) survivors were really strong. If you had some friends and you played SWF you could definitely make the killer ragequit. It was kinda like cyberbullying (insta flashlights vacuum pallets 100% healingspeed with selfcare infinites and so on). I am a survivor main myself (and a nurse main) and I defenintely agree with the recent patches which removed/changed broken survivor items perks or like serveral edits to maps. The only thing that annoyed me is that in nearly every patch the survivors receive a nerf. These nerfs aren't necessarily big but over the time the game it gets different the gameplay the items/perks you use the game you used to know. I personally don't like the current state of the game not because im a toxic survivor main just because the game changed alot. If you're a good killer you know how to play against survivors and get a 4 man almost every game. If you are planning on buying the game this will probably be how the game will look like for you at first sight. A bit unbalanced (LOL A BIT... A BIT.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!

Everybody is sitting in their killer lobbies waiting for people who want to try and hide from them and repair generators (yay) which won't come because everyone is trying to play a killer. And if you try to play a survivor (GIving up on the queue.) You can't get into a game because you get one or two people and everybody else is a killer waiting for survivors. There is an easy fix for this and that is to randomly select the role for every quick game. And no I don't mean keep the option on the side because EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A KILLER. I will keep following the game but until this feature or a similar one is added it is unplayable. Because all you do now is wait in a queue for god knows how long only to be chased by a killer die (Which would be a fun experience if not for...) and then sit in a queue for another ridiculous amount of time and when you want to play killer good luck because if you go afk during the MASSIVE wait time and you get into a game you are losing time in your precious 10 20 minutes of actaul fun.PS I'd like to note that in my 2 hours of playtime I've been in 2 games each of which I was a survivor got my kicked and the games were over in 10 minutes.

THIS IS NOT A COMPETITIVE GAME it\\'s all a screen.I personally think all the problems from the game derive from the fact the core mechanic/gameplay is too simple so there\\'s no room for making any big changes. I guess you can tell because the devs keep trying to \"fix\" it by just messing with numbers. This needs a huge if not full rework you know rethink the game as a whole. The current recipe its just not cutting it. \"Do 5 gens open door get out. Killer finds you run in circles drop pallets\" That\\'s pretty much it and since the game comes down pretty much to the chase you can\\'t really add killers with interesting mechanics because they automatically are low tier if their power doesn\\'t directly help them in the chase.A few layers of complexity are needed because of the simplicity of the game (everything comes down to the chase) a lot of the current mechanics aren\\'t even used/relevant anymore like stealth. Then there\\'s all the items/perks that in combination pretty much gives you god mode like bringing 4 bnp or having infinite evil within 3 or 1 shot hatches you know things that trivialize the game objectives to me that tells me all these things were added by paper never tested in a practical scenario.I think it\\'s a pretty big red flag when half the \"mechanics\" of your game are in there JUST to prevent exploits (this is an online game is nothing new they should have known that ppl would find those holes and exploit them) like the hooks regenerating after being sabotaged the windows getting blocked being able to unhook from any angle blood lust etc all those things don\\'t even blend into the game there are just there to address problems the devs didn\\'t foresee which tells you they weren\\'t ready for making a game like this which is understandable all asimetric games so far were true vs as in each party could eliminate the other not like in this one where one side\\'s goal is to eliminate and the other\\'s goal is to escape.

If you're a killer who gets 4 kills (the maximum) you won't get rewarded a double pip (the maximum reward)... on the survivors' scale of things they've made it competitive/all around (must do some of everything) but what does this promote? Survivors must now follow a meta.Anything that gets proposed to reduce the overall meta of the game which is nurse/billy for killers and Decisive Strike/Sprint Burst/Self care perks for survivors.... neither side of the community will agree on their metas being nerfed (killer mains will defend the top killers survivor mains will defend the top survivor perks).... so the devs always bait themselves into this viscious cycle of always choosing the side that cried the loudest for the other side to be nerfed (resulting in an imbalanced game)... and this has been going back and forth for years. It calmed down 6 months ago (nearly 40k people were playing back then... we're down to 20k ish) but now we've had so many perks/killers kicked out from being viable (the survivors learnt how to counter doctor and huntress at this point... they're not really viable... only full proof huntresses remain and they're rarer than a full proof nurse... whom would still be stronger).Overall... the devs are too afraid to make balance changes for the game because they fear a backlash from either side... the only changes they make are to further nerf perks barely anyone was using. The devs actually need to man the up and nerf both sides... let the survivor mains and killer mains cry it out. Get over it and watch them stay. They're not the ones who left.

       " 'Overall score 2.5/10Let me preface this review by saying I USED to LOVE this game. Before we got patch 1.4 the game was in a stable but still enjoyable state. I\\'ll give you the problems it had then and still has now in a minute but I wanted to get that out of the way first.Back then survivors had to avoid the killer or they would die quickly losing their pips and going down in rank instead of up and they knew it. Back then killers were\\'t overpowered but most still needed some bandages to their kits to help them out and even then every killer had a playstyle. Let me go ahead and list out the good the bad (What could easily be fixed) And the ugly (What clearly needs to be addressed ASAP)The good*Depending on your experience with your killer of choice you can be EXTREMELY powerful. As for myself I am a Hag and Huntress main and do not regret it. Both are solid killers with playstyles I like.*Graphics are very solid. Prestiging killers especially feels rewarding with bloodied clothing or new items to use for customization and bloody weapons actually drip blood if you pay attention to them. *Map generation is almost always randomized and you will almost never get the same map twice because of it.*Windows block survivors after they or the killer total 3 vaults over it.The bad*The devs never solved the problem of \"Infinites.\" Infinites are basically pregenerated map pieces that include pallets and windows in specific places making actually catching the survivor take a MUCH longer time to do wasting the killer\\'s time. More on that in a minute. There was a minor change to map generation to help solve this but it did not work.*Some killers are completely outclassed. The Wraith the Shape and The Nightmare are the ones I\\'m looking at here. All three have decent kits but with infinites being a huge problem right now they can almost never get a kill.The UGLY*Pallet Looping is an absurd problem and if you don\\'t know why go watch someone streaming this game as a killer and I guarantee it will happen in every game. \"Pallet Looping\" refers to a tactic when the survivors use hitboxes to their advantage. How? Survivor hitboxes are smaller than the killer and any area with pallets will have something else around to act as obstacles. Trees boxes things of that nature. The survivors can run laps around such things and since their hitbox is smaller than the killer\\'s they can not only gain ground this way but they can also decide to wait for the killer and throw the pallet down to stun them but if it were just one pallet it wouldn\\'t be too bad. Most of the areas on the maps have more than one pallet in close proximity and survivors will loop the killers around EVERY ONE of them to waste their time. Which leads me into...*Time. To escape survivors have to repair five of seven generators which doesn\\'t sound too bad. Four survivors one killer and the gens take a decent amount of time to repair. But coupled with infinites and pallet looping you will watch multiple generators get done in the time it takes you to down even one survivor if they have half a brain and loop you well. To actually KILL a survivor you need to either (A) Mori them after they have been hooked once (B) let them bleed out on the ground which takes about 2 3 minutes total or (C) hook them until the entity sacrifices them which can be up to 3 times depending on how altruistic the other survivors are. Why is this a problem? Here are your options.(A) Down a survivor and camp them which they will then spam the struggle button instead of hold it so they raise their arms up and down alerting their friends (Who can see this arm waving) that you are there and to do generators(B) Hook a survivor and walk away which will prompt one of their friends to save them and let them start infiniting you again*Survivors WILL be s to you. This is a fact of life. With multiple clearly overpowered perks and no counters to any of them survivors know that THEY are in control of the game not you. Yeah you can kill them as the killer but killing even one rank 1 survivor with the game in the state it is in will cost you the entire game and you will sit there watching them T bag you taunt you stun you with flashlights/pallets and constantly get away from you for FREE laughing at you the entire time. Closing statements? The game right now is NOT worth playing. As a player with over 650 hours and counting in hopes the game recovers at the moment I would say wait for it to be on a heavy sale if you REALLY want it but otherwise go play something else. The killers are supposed to make you be afraid of them they are supposed to be the ones in control and with the power but the way the game is right now there\\'s nothing they can do. Survivors are constantly getting buffs and killers are getting nerfed and the devs will not address the clear problems that would solve the issues killers face to make the game fun on both sides. Nobody wants to get trolled every game being frustrated and angry that they cant kill a single survivor. It will make you extremely unhappy and make you feel like you wasted your money.If the devs fix pallet looping and put decisive strike back the way it was (Where only the obsession can use it) then the game can go back to a state of relative balance. Killers will be back where they belong as the ones in control. Until that happens save your money and spend it on something better. If I see relative improvement I would happily recommend this game and would gladly change the way I see it.',\n",

With this new killer its makes the game unplayable as you can't see him can outrun you and see you all the time when he is not chasing you. Also the fact you can not exit the dreamworld without help in which you lead him to other survivors. In my view they should nerf the F### out of him like for example a way to get out of the dream world by using the 'snap out of it' function from when you play against the doctor.

Terribly unbalanced. Some killers have perks which for the most part seems to be balanced but when there are only a couple or just one survivor left its over powered. For instance a clown camped a hatch chucked his gas things and had literally no cool down. This allowed him to keep spamming it and camp the hatch and the remaining generator which was close to the hatch as well.2. Broken hitboxes. Absolute garbag hitboxes. I thought FPS games had horrible hitboxes but this game takes the cake for being the absolute WORST. A killer can hit you even though he swung at the air. 3. Broken animations. A killer can lunge at you from a mile away because this is how the animation works so it completely ignores the killers original speed and goes Usain Bolt and hits you. Other times you see a pallet and you try to throw it down but it doesn't because it doesn't show the space bar option even though you are directly in front of it and looking at it.4. Extremely toxic community. Surviors will disconnect at the beginning for a pathetic punishment. No points and a potential derank. Wow! This is even worse when it comes to killers who disconnect because the survivors got all the generators and so the game just stops. Ridiculous how abandoners get absolutely no cool down whatsoever for ruining it for everyone else.5. Awful servers. Your connection as a survivor depends on the killers connection. If the killers get 300 ping then so do you. If the killer lag switches and unplugs his ethernet then you freeze as well.

       " 'Absolutely horrendous matchmaking is the only real complaint I have about this game. It works the same general way matchmaking in Dark Souls works in that the game spends several seconds searching for a suitable match before automatically quitting and forcing you to ready up again rather than actively searching until you connect with someone doing the same. In other words it is a requirement that another person hits \"Ready\" at the exact moment you do for you to be matched together otherwise the game will stop searching after quite literally 2 seconds.Somewhat recommended if you want to play alone or with TWO other friends as finding suitable matches is much simpler and faster this way due to the fact that solo players are often teamed up instantly with each other or teams of three. However I can\\'t remotely recommended this if you\\'re only here to play with one other friend as finding a suitable match is extremely rare and tedious when you\\'re two teamed players.To conclude in its current state I wouldn\\'t recommend anyone to spend this much money on a MP only game with such a broken matchmaking system.',\n",

The Dead by Daylight community is are some of the worst in any game childish complainers disconnectors and mean people who are not kind or understanding to people starting out. I am talking worst then any Blizzrd game. But it is hard to please two both sides the killers and survivors who are at constant odds with one another.

It is definetly fun for both sides and best enjoyed with a full set of friends but alone online is fun too. Here is a +/ list to give you an overview+++ different maps in which the objects are generated at random points \"skill\" trees in which you hunt the most rare and useful perks and offerings Now with party system different killers and survivors let you choose your playstyle intense gameplay balanced. The devs bring updates even to the smallest balance issues Sometimes crashes although I haven t experienced it much myself no tutorial and near to 0 videos make it hard to understand for beginners. Especially when trying to figure out how offerings are used and when you should burn them graphics. This isn t really a negative point but its unreal engine 4 for crying out loud. But still I m happy with it 20$ cost. IMO it is worth but especially if you haven t played the beta this price might keep you off buying this gem DC s. Often a survivor isconnects only giving 1250 points for sacrfice and 650 points for quitting. This might be too few to give you the rank up and might leave you frustratedSummary IMHO this game is worth the money. It is not enough for a 40$ game (see verwatch) but definetly worth the 20$. This game doesn t focus on the graphics but on the balanced gameplay and the sheer fun you can have with friends or alone. And since the game is new I am sure that they will fix a lot of issues and add more killers / survivors and even maps ( They confirmed this if im right).This game deserves a 8 / 10 in it s genreᑫ ل ᑷ',\n",

Mechanics are frustrating if you are a rager you'll break your keyboard. 7e is the maximum price for the work done.Pros Scary for 30 minutes. After that you get used to.

Guess how laggy it can be.You think you juked the killer ? Think again he just teleported to you because pressing left mouse button does that.He disconnects after a game of 15 minutes because he could lose ranks he isn't punished but the survivors may lose ranks.Map design Procedural ? having a few elements moving at random spots doesnt make it procedural it's just random.Procedural generation ? There are 3 maps per area and 3 areas. All the map are likely similar. The procedural generation is barely visible.Maps are badly designed and unbalanced.Invisible walls invisible hitbox on trees and rockGrinding systemPrestige thing .... worthless that's an artifice to boost the lifetime of the game.7 Characters to level up if you want to reach the engame.The teamPublisher strabreeze. They made Payday2 unpopular after it was mega hyped.Devs are mute. No words.Moderation team on steam forums threatens people of game ban for no reasons.

       " 'Edited to account for new patches.TLDR I really like this game the only iffy parts are minor ranking/technical issues. If things like achievements not working occasional animation bugs and some items being unbalanced bother you then wait a little while until they\\'re fixed.Positives The gameplay is fairly well balanced although it may not seem like it when you first start out as some things can only be learned through experience. But at the end of the day you can complete your goals as either a survivor or killer and have a good chance as either. The random generation of map and elements means that both sides need to consider the map layout in their actions. Survivors don\\'t automatically know where the generators are and the killers don\\'t automatically know where survivors are likely to camp items as chest locations change. All the killers have different playstyles and all the survivors specialize in different things. A match where the trapper is the killer will be played differently than a match where the wraith is the killer. A match with 3 lvl 15 jakes will be played differently than a match with all 4 characters. If you screw up as a survivor it is not an immediate game over your friends can save you or you can salvage the situation. This makes it slightly easier on new players.Negatives Gameplay Edition The tutorial teaches the main points and nothing else. While there is only so much strategy a tutorial can teach in a multiplayer game some basic elements like all the uses of items are only stated on the wiki outside of the game and not in the tutorials. Currently the game is geared towards the selfish survivor. You are much more likely to escape if you repair generators while the killer is busy with your friends than if you risk life and limb to save them. Balance issues most of which are minor Any new survivor player will have difficulty if the wraith is the killer on enclosed maps as they won\\'t have the perks to know when he\\'s coming and the enclosed areas mean they can\\'t visually see him. The flashlight is very underpowered and about as effective as it would be in real life. Negatives Tech Edition No queueing with friends (As of 6/16/2016). You can host private games but you and 2 friends can\\'t all queue in a group to get the full number of people. Ranking issues Rank is currently not an indication of skill and there are 2 main categories of players those who rank up indefinately and those who don\\'t care about rank and are continuously at rank 20 even as their characters get more and more skills and perks. (I\\'m not an amazing player but I have a lot of perks as a crutch and if ranking was alright myself and quite a few others would probably be at rank 15 18 instead of at 20 shredding the poor newbies.) Minor bugs some of which are funny (animation bugs) and some of which are annoying. It is possible for a hatch to be invisible and uninteractive even after the requirements to open it are met. If the trapper places a trap under a hooked player then their teammates can\\'t disarm it because the \"unhook\" prompt takes priority over the \"disarm\" prompt.',\n",

When it does find something it either bugs out or kicks us meaning we have to reform the group.On the opposite side as a killer. I played the trapper quite a bit and liked him. But after the free weekend ended I started to notice more and more unbalanced matches. Ones where survivors were able to literally run circles around me while I was unable to actually do anything because all my hooks were either across the map in the basement or destroyed.This culminated today when after failing to find matches as a group we disbanded and I attempted to try the new Nurse killer for the first time due to a quest. There is absolutely ZERO reason that I should be going up against teams of survivors with 3 4 nearly maxed out sets of perks while I don\\'t have even a second perk slot unlocked on ANY character. All this while also trying to learn the nurse\\'s teleport mechanic.The cherry on top is like any online game the craptastic community.

       " 'Games last like 4 5 minutes takes 80 seconds for a survivor to complete 1/5 generators so basically what happens is 3 survivors work on generators while the killer chases around the 4th survivor who probably did about half of his own generator before the chase started. Depending on the survivors skill the chase may last anywhere from 20 40+ seconds if they are a new player or multiple minutes if they are a moderate or above skilled player. The \"chase\" consists of running in circles around garbage piles and dropping garbage pallets in front of the killer while also occasionally jumping through windows. Eventually all 5 generators will be completed and the exit gates opened. Survivors are also armed with tools to make repairing the generators faster tools to blind the killer and make him drop the survivor he just spent 3 minutes chasing and perks that just straight up let a survivor jump off the back of the killer and run away. The big issue is that there is a \"skill cap\" for killers meaning they reach a point where they can no longer \"be better\" the killer has to rely on the survivor making a mistake to finally make a good play and even then survivors have multiple second chances to get out of it.So playing survivor is too easy. You sit and hold left click for 80 seconds on your generator and then help work on the last ones or you run around garbage piles and windows for 3 minutes while your team does the gens. I felt bad FOR THE KILLER alot of games I saw teamates teabagging the killer behind pallets or after flashlight blinding him and making him drop the guy he was chasing for 3 minutes.And playing the killer...well...I would describe it as feeling somewhere in the realm of a 8 year olds hat being thrown back and forth over him between two 16 year old high school bullies while he runs back and forth trying to grab it...yes...that\\'s how it feels to play THE KILLER....When balance issues where brought up to the game director he said \"play something else...try civilization\" they obviously dont care about player feedback.So I cannot recommend this game the concept is awesome...but that\\'s about it.

I hope they let players choose the server like i heard people said it was in the good old daysif you are looking to buy this game i warn you here please dont. most of my time in this game is only pure upset and angry. it is not noob friendly! many vets player cheat on the matching system to lower their rank and allow them to play with noob but with their highest level skills and equipment they see you as pure blood point earning tool only you are there only for their daily mission. this game is DEAD to me. if you bought the whole DLC and you were just a noob like me then i wish you would have the fun you were expecting at the beginning and hope you are not hot tempered cause im a usually clam person and this must be the first time i got so p i s s e d on the net after being played like a fool by higher lvl player and being taunt and challenge everyday i finaly lost my s h i t i admit that. 10 / 9 time i encounter a Thailand player as a surrvivor they will try their best to not just beat you in game(witch i am total okay with) but going further to show off and make you have suck gaming exprience that is their gaming culture you can only avoid them in game or stop playing like me am i a total i n g racist? yes i am after this game they have change my impression of them. but you know what im telling is true indeed if you are currently playing HERE IS MY ADVICE PLAY WITH FRIEND ONLY. PRIVATE MATCH IS THE BEST WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO PLAY ALONE GG.to Thailand players i been in thai for years i know how you people are. you must feel very heroic and brave while taunting noob killer and while laughing at them during your steam. there is nothing here to stop you. but i hope game player from the globe will despite all of you one day and i will do as much as i can to insult you people in other game.',\n",

There are quite a few major ones that have stuck around patch after patch. Very often they manage to bring bugs that they \"fixed\\' back in the next patch.I had hoped the DLC they just released would be amazing and show that they listen to their community. They hyped up the new killer as \"game breaking\" and \"players will scream OP\" What we got was a mediocre survivor and a killer who is only slightly better than the weakest killer.

And thus begins a horrible cycle of ever increasing power creep which will if it continues unabated will result in the vanilla content being unplayable when compared to the wildly powerful DLC content.The thing that made Payday 2 bareable when this happend is that its a player vs an AI controlled computer. and the computer can't complain about things being unfair and has no real concept of fairness because its not alive.But in a Player vs Player game like this one where both sides are controlled by living thinking breathing humans not only is all the atmosphere of a horror game lost but so is the all important sense of fair balance.And I don't care what the Hunter mains say. Being able to hide from you and not be spotted instantly by t detect life spells IS NOT unbalanced gameplay.

The Devs have grown to only want money and do not care about their fanbase. They either nerf killers and call it balanced or nerf survivors and say the same. The game is not balanced and unless you\\'re a sadist or masochist you will not enjoy this game. They only break the game more with each update and only care about their new game DeathGarden which positively sucks There are also more hackers now because the Devs do nothing to stop it. They did a \"Tournement\" which had so many hackers it wasn\\'t funny. They had an announcer who knew absolutely nothing about the game and refused to listen when people callled out hackers. My friend was banned from a Dev\\'s stream when telling some issues with a killer he was having. There is no longer a way to contact the devs and the game is slowly going dowhill quickly. Some suggestions if I may.1. Instead of putting more cosmetics in the game actually fix the bugs that are present. Cosmetics mean nothing if you\\'re permenently stuck in one place due to a bug. 2. reach out to the players. You\\'re making people wanna stop playing with the ranking system. A new killer should not be with rank 10 survivors and vise versa. Also with the hackers it makes others who are veterans not want to play this game. 3. fix the balancing. You removed pallets but people still get face camped and looped. The toxcicity of the players are from them. So with balancing fix the exhaustion perks debuff. If you\\'re running balanced landing you should be able to recover from exhaustion when you jump down. You will eventually get cornered and killed. Also fix the whole body blocking scenario. If a killer can block you from moving that\\'s a major flaw. this goes for survivors being able to trap killers in \"fatshame\" places. 4. Fix the EAC. Make it so it actually stops hackers. Simple5. Updates should focus on fixing the game not ruining it. With every update as I\\'ve said it breaks the game. It tips it to one side each time. Killers should not be able to face camp. Maybe fix that in your very important COSMETICS Update.

The biggest issue with this game is that it's not remotely fun for casual players if they choose the survivor role. At the starting rank you will often be placed with killers who are experienced and have high level perks making them almost impossible to beat (bare in mind it is difficult enough as a survivor because of how OP killers are). In order to win as a survivor you pretty much need a whole team on teamspeak and even then most games you'll all be sacrificed. Killers also get far more points even if they only manage to kill one of you they often get more points than some of the survivors. Not everyone wants to play the meta fix the balance please.In summary Killers are faster they can one shot you they see the generators and just circle them they can stand by a hook and watch you die to prevent rescure they use perks to see/hunt you even if you hide well or dodge well.\",\n",

It's buggy it has balancing issues its online system is faulty its ranked system is broken. Also to create a sense of progression this game shouldn't have to add in leveling and perks. You shouldn't be able to bring items into the game.

       " 'EDIT I continued to find more flaws with the game after playing many hours of it so I will add edits and extras where they are due Time for an angry as fu ck review This game is just so fu cking terrible. Pretty much everything about this game makes me hate it. I\\'ll give you a list of reasons why NOT to buy this game 1. Whenever I try to play as a Survivor it won\\'t connect me. Litearrly one half of the entire FU CKING game is blocked off for me. I\\'m not entirely sure if this is just an issue of too people playing as Murderers but that\\'s their fault not mine. If I\\'m playing the game I want to actually PLAY the game. 2. There are almost NO FU CKING SKINS. There are about 10 slots for all of the different skins you can collect but the only skin you can unlock is this bloody skin for being Level 50 which equates to about 50 hours of this shi tty game. I\\'ve been told that they\\'re gonna add more in the future but at least give us one fu cking skin that doesn\\'t take 50 hours to unlock! Everyone just looks exactly the same. I just hate games that release early and then give you all the s hit later. Sure I\\'m totally fine with a game wanting to release a game early so more people can play it but at least give me something I can play with. EDIT Wow one actual extra skin for every character. And it only took 3 weeks to happen! I\\'m glad that they actually added a new set of skins but I\\'m sticking with my original statement.3. The ranking system really pisses me off. I hate it so much. Basically you need to survive 3 games and die in 0 of them in order to rank up (which is damn near impossible). After multiple hours I was finally able to get to rank 19 but then I lost 2 games and am literally back to the same position I was before. I really fu cking hate it4. The Murderers just watch the people on the fu cking hooks. It means that you can\\'t save your friend because they\\'ll just ing beat you a couple of times and wait for them to die. The only reason this happens is because of the game mechanics. There\\'s no reason to actively hunt players when you\\'re watching one on a hook because the generators take so fu cking long to fix. Whenever I play as Murderer I fu cking have to watch the people on the hooks otherwise they get saved and I have to search for them all over again which is just fuc king annoying as hell.5. The generators as previously mentioned suck so much to fix. They\\'re slow as fu ck unless you somehow find other people to help you fix them and they constantly send you into this arcade game style \"Press the Button at a specific time\" thing. When you fail to fix it especially when the game fuc king lags out and makes you miss it the generator alerts the ing Murderer and they can easily find you. You also have to fix 5 of those fuc kers when in a full match which is basically impossible.6. THE FU CKING NEED TO FIND HELP S HIT. When you get hit by a Murderer twice you reamin prone and crawl around at about 2 meters an hour. I\\'ve seen snails zoom passed me while I was prone. The problem with being prone is that you literally cannot get the back up unless you find help. So if the murderer gets all 4 of you on prone there is LITERALLY no way you can win. The game does this Recover thing where you can sit there doing fuc king nothing execpt lie there like a dumbass and \"heal\". However when you finishing Recovering which is slower than the fu cking generators you are told you need to find help. FU CK YOU. WHY WOULD I NEED TO FIND HELP IF I\\'VE SAT HERE FOR FIVE MINUTES \"RECOVERING?\" It\\'s fu cking idiotic. I hate being fu cking lied to about that s hit.7. The items get burned every time you play with them. The items you earn through spending this stupid fuc king Blood Currency can only be used once in a game. So when I spend 5 000 blood points on some fuc king springs for my trap I can\\'t use it again. It\\'s just fuc king annoying and discourages you from spending any of your money on their 8. The game is extremely fuc king confusing. Half of the perks you unlock make no sense (What the f uck does \"Decreases your chances of landing in Fuc kboi Manor when on fire\" mean?) Also when you spawn into a game two or three random perks just kinda pop up and then fly the away. I don\\'t think you can earn them so it makes no sense why you\\'d have them in the first place.9. Overall unrealistic gameplay. Who the fu ck stands next to a box of wood while a murderer is chasing after them and just pulls it down? That box of wood is literally so fuc king annoying when you\\'re the Murderer. The game sometimes glitches out so while you\\'re far enough way from the box so that you\\'re not touching it and someone pulls it down you still get hit by it and spend five fuc king seconds standing there like a dum bass. Also the bear trap barely works and half the time when people run into the places you set them down they just run off with nothing happening to them. Whenever you hit someone as the Murderer you kinda lick the blood and it slows you down. It\\'s fuc king annoying and half the time I lose players because of it. Also why the fu ck does my character take 15 seconds to pull down a FUC KING LEVER in order to escape? It\\'s obviously just that the DEVs wanted escape to take awhile but they have no ing imagination and thought people would be okay with you having to pull down a lever for 15 minutes.10. People just disconnect all the fuc king time. When you Murder someone there\\'s no reason for them to stay so they pretty much always leave. It\\'s just fuc king annoying and shows how little people care about those they\\'re playing with in this game. I mean I really can\\'t blame them the game\\'s just so shi tty.11. The maps are pretty ing monotonous and all the same. Sure you can\\'t memorize where different generators are and because it\\'s procedurally generated but every map looks the same and has the exact same sh it every fuc king time.12. It\\'s so hard to fuc king escape as the Survivor. The Murderer is faster than you and the only way to get an edge on them is by jumping over an obviously placed obstacle that takes the Murderer half an hour to step over or those previously mentioned crates. It\\'s just fuc king annoying and you\\'re pretty much screwed whenever the Murderer finds you. Sure there have been some instances when I\\'ve escaped but they were mainly because the Murderer had no idea what they were doing and I faked them out.13. This game is just fuc king terrible.14. Rubber band lag (which occurs about every 4 5 games) makes the game unplayable so I basically just auto leave.15. Whenever you use an item it automatically spawns you with it for the next game which wastes is so fu cking quickly. I just don\\'t see any reason why a player would continue to want to waste their items therefore needing this system.There you go 15 reasons why not to buy this game. I\\'ll probably think of more but I fu cking hated writing this review \\'cause the game\\'s so sh itty and I don\\'t want to type anymore.If you\\'re a rich piece of and you\\'re wiping your with twenties here are a couple of reasons why you should buy the game So I can actually play as the fuc king Survivor The graphics aren\\'t except for the fact that on the lobby screen every character does the exact same thing The music is kinda nice but it\\'s literally a loop of the same fu cking guitar for about 10 seconds. On second thought it fuc king sucks. I actually enjoy playing with friends it\\'s pretty fun and we all end up laughing. That\\'s basically the only Pro I have for this game.So yeah if you like this game you have a disability.Fu ck you all CranberryElf6',\n",

You really need to mess up as a killer to drop in rank.Furthermore the grind to level up is very long also because of perks that are useless. There are some perks so useless that when you would combine two of them it would still be useless (like 'this is not happening' and 'deja vu'). If you are new to the game a camping killer will ruin your experience. Unfortunately most of them will be campers at the lower ranks as its easier and will still reward the killer with points. Also if you're starting to play as a killer you'll be annoyed by people who use infinite loops. But you'll learn how to deal with both cases as you get better.Then the matchmaking. You'll hear it from everyone but it's true. The matchmaking isn't just bad it's terrible.

Well let's start with the palets if you find a looper he will go around the obstacles in the palet area for well let's say forever and it ing sucks cause you have to catch the dude and you lose time by doing so ! Also if you let him go cause you don't wanna spend precious time by trying to catch him bad for you cause guess what he is still alive ! As for the windows omfg on the Institute and Hadon it's a ing nightmare and Springwood and Auto are super full of palets yep you're right you are as good as dead on this map and wow you play killer which cannot die ! If we are talking about generators well that's the most ing OP part of the game for survivors they can repair it but not one not two all 4 of them ! 4 survivors on a generator ? Let's rush them all then and holly sweet mother of cool games they really do it just to make you get angry ! About perks hmmm they cand disable your perks if you are using a hex for instance ! Now let me get this straight it's 4 against one you can do all this i just talked about and you can also disable my hex ? Jesus christ so unbalanced ! You wanna know about items ? All are cool really but the flashlight ... isn't it too ed up when i work so hard to catch a survivor and when i finally do one of you comes around and blinds me with the almighty flashlight that is so powerful than the ing sun itself ? Let's not forget about body blocking oh yeah that part of the game when i catch someone and i try to take him to a hook but guess what ? Survivors can rush your and block you so can't get to the hook ! Of course you will hit them to get away but that means only more time for the survivor to wiggle and get free from your grasp ! Also if you didn't know if they down a palet on your you will drop the survivor cool right ? And finally after you worked you so much for almost nothing they power the generators and they can escape but it's ok cause you say ok i'll guard the gate and they won't get out ! Sadly my friend they have 2 gates they can use to escape ! Like it's not enough they also have a hatch spawned somewhere on the map that leads to freedom ! I would be ok with all of that cause when they release a DLC i pay for that mother ing killer to have it as paid for it but no a crybaby survivor can complain cause it's right to do so and my dear killer that paid money for gets nurfed ( cause it's OP . you know ) to the point that he is no longer a killer just a useless puppet that i can control and get done with it cause it was OP once and needed to be nerfed ! Don't get me wrong the idea of the game is awesome but seriously it's too ing unbalanced in the advantage of the survivors ! If you want to play survivor with your friends it's cool yo will have lots of fun but if you are buying the game for the killers you are giving your money for nothing ! With all that being said your game untill you don't do something to balance this i'm out ! You guys just lost not only a customer but also a devoted player !\",\n",

There are less and less confrontational gameplay with survivors against killers due to the changes made to self care bnp exhaustion perks flashlights etc. so the way the game is going its completely killer sided. I understand that it is an asymmetrical game and that killers should have more power over the 4 survivors but the majority can agree that the killers are simply receiving too much at this moment.The developers have listened to the complaints of the minorities and the game is no longer as fun as before.

       " '\"Dead by Daylight\" or as I like to call it \"Kite the Killer \" is a disappointment on some many different levels. The idea of the game itself seems promising but in its current state I\\'m afraid it fails one too many levels to be fun.The public seems to have caught the 4v1 genre bug and two of the most current titles that come to mind are (the superior) \"Unfortunate Spacemen\" and impending \"Friday the 13th\" release. I\\'ve certainly caught this bug and had high hopes for this game but my heart sank quickly after I began playing the game.First let me explain how a round is won. As the Killer you must find and melee hit a survivor twice (or once with the comically useless \"Chainsaw\" trait but more on that later). On the second hit you pick the survivor up and must find a sacrifice hook to hang the survivor on which if left there after about a min or two the hook comes alive and \"digests\" the survivor. Okay....As one of four survivors you must start three of six generators to restore power to open one of three electrical doors and escape thus winning the round.#1 The survivors have no real way to attack the Killer however they run just about as fast as the killer and are capable of pushing debris and obstacles in front of the Killer\\'s path. They are able to leap through windows about 75% faster than a killer can climb through. So in essence speed is absolutely on the survivors side and in most cases this is absolutely a problem hence the laughable kiting. It\\'s hard enough to find a survivor as it is and when the Killer finally does come barreling down on them the survivor has 2 practically fail safe ways to escape Spam debris pushes while running in a zig zag pattern or run to a two story house where the survivor will run to the upper balcony and wait for the Killer to lumber on up before jumping off. When the Killer pursues the survivor just runs back up rinse repeat until the Killer gets disorientated or annoyed and leaves or the remaining three survivors turn on the generators. I\\'ve never seen a game penalize a hunter for cornering his prey.#2 While the description of this game \"emphasizes\" team work I\\'ve never seen a team game promote the team splitting up and having everyone go solo. The maps are a good medium to large size with numerous generators to start at all corners of the map. When the team splits up say north south east west this makes the killers run around chasing his own tail even though he is alerted to the generators starting up. This takes time which allows the numerous survivors just repair away no problem. But even if the killer does pick a correct generator that a survivor is at ...#3 ... The survivors have numerous alerts to let them the Killer is coming to them. First there is a \"Heart beat\" system which basically an alarm is giving the survivors a good 5 second warning the Killer is headed their way. There are also numerous perks which allow a survivor to know if the Killer is looking in their direction i.e. actually has a clue where they are currently hiding. Any chance of stealth and successfully navigating to a survivor s position on the Killer\\'s part is undercut by the numerous alarms the survivors have who will immediately hide upon hearing those alarms. The Killer can attempt to find the survivor in the area all while three other survivors diligently work on their generators. The moment the Killer moves out of the area and the alarms stop the survivor returns working on the generator rinse repeat. If the Killer does miraculously find the survivor ... Kite the Killer waste his time. Rinse Repeat.#4 Practically all Killer abilities are useless. The ones that aren\\'t barely do anything. Vanilla Killer is Vanilla Killer. The Killer can have three loadouts The \"Bear Trap\" loadout ... allows the killer to place traps around the map to snare a survivor. Sounds like a good idea and possibly an answer to the circular kiting but wait even though there are like 10 traps spread out through the map you can only have one active at a time. That makes sense. You have the \"Wraith\" loadout which makes you invisible however it takes a good 4 seconds for you to re materialize and your presence while invisible still alerts the survivor that you are in the area and by the time you re materialize the survivors see you and the Kiting begins. And finally you have the \"Chainsaw\" loadout which is 100% useless. The chainsaw give you a charge ability that if you actually hit a survivor instantly knocks them down for you to pick them up and hook them however while fast you can only charge in a straight line attacking the first thing you clip. This means that the by simply listening for the chainsaw to rev (it takes about three seconds for the ability to charge and release) the survivor can turn left or right or simply move a piece of debris in the Killer\\'s path. The Killer will either miss the mark complete and go charging way out of the vicinity (if the Killer is lucky enough to even find an open patch of map) or he will clip any little thing before even getting to the survivor comically slamming into walls debris etc. while the survivor kites.#5 The matchmaking system is a joke. Like the best joke of the year. You\\'re a level 1 Killer? Well prepare to go again level 20 survivors who are just full of perks. Get ready to be taunted by a team of 4 who will turn on all 6 generators for the hell of it and open all 3 exits while running circles around you while spamming you with their flashlights and kiting you.#6 With team making patches get ready for #5 issues to go through the roof as players use Skype or someone outside com program to coordinate with one another while the Killer stands in the middle of the map getting rolled.#7 Even if by grace of the Gaming Gods you are able to attack and capture a survivor the hooks (unlike the mob of generators) are spread thin all over the map. And to top it off the survivor can still escape your clutches while being carried. I\\'d say realistically you have about 20 seconds to get the survivors to a hook before they break free. Did I mention you move twice as slow carrying a survivor? Did I mention when the survivor escapes you are basically kicked downwards and spun around for a few seconds giving that survivor a head start ... to start the Kite game over? Rinse. Repeat.If this was a finished product upon purchase I would have returned it but I try to support studios and products that have potential so I kept it and will see how it pans out. In closing the concept has potential ... but I really don\\'t hold out much hope. I just don\\'t see how the devs are going to fix and balance these problems without major overhauls.

Only workaround is to lobby hop lots of times and pray. can't adjust gamma. my lighting setting is rather poor and I need to adjust those values in order to actually being able to distinguish between rocks and trees let alone survivors and rocks can't adjust volume by element (such as music ambience heartbeat etc..) just total volume keys aren't rebindable afaik lobbies are full of jumpers (see above) afk people no idle kick it seems poorly designed survivors (on ultra they're pretty crappy) killer seems to have it pretty easy and probably wins most of the time (aka how am I supposed to power 4 generators with 1v1?)Summary Don't buy until patched.With lots of tweaks and fixes (that should've been done during beta lol) it could end up being a good game.\",\n",
       " \"The game just isn't fun without a group of friends to play with. Matchmaking sucks if you're just trying to play to have fun. The perk system means that if you want to play at parity with veterans it's a long tedious grind. So if you don't have a core group to play with and don't want to spend 10 15 hours playing catch up don't buy it.Evidently they also reset the rankings once a month. This doesn't remove unlocked perks and abilities. So if you on or around the 13th and you're new good luck. Your fellow bottom rankers will have access to abilities and powers that you've never seen. Bad matchmaking means that if you're coming here for a fun scary game you aren't going to get it unless you bring four other friends with you.\",\n",

I truly enjoyed this game in the beggining because you could play solo and everyone was on an even field however due to recent killers and perks added to the game along with their new currency system they have heavily favored killers experience over that of the survivors as well as being mainly in it for the money since feedback from the regular population for this game is overlooked and laughed about. I do not reccomend this game because I have had a more negative experience on this game then i have in any other multiplayer game of this genre in my lifetime.

Evolve shines where Dead by Daylight fails. As a survivor you have to deal with (at this point in time) 1 of 3 killers. The main mechanic to evading killers is awareness (seeing the killer) and your senses telling you the killer is near via a heartbeat sound. However one of the killers completely circumvents this mechanic.I\\'m sorry a CORE mechanic to your game and everyone is honestly surprised that everyone is picking the Wraith? How droll. And for anyone saying \"well I\\'ve won X games as hillbilly\" or \"I\\'ve evaded the wrath plenty of times\" Guess what a good wraith is going to be far enough away from a particular spot (not moving) and unless you have the eyesight of a raven you aren\\'t going to spot him in time to run away. As the survivor it\\'s an extremely frustrating experience being unable to see your fellow survivors unless they are in mortal peril. It\\'s also very frustrating having NO communication ability whatsoever. I hope Friday the 13th does this time of horror survival genre better.

The developers of this game really care about this game they released so much patches and new content over the last 16 months.Just a lil\\' heads up This game had 3 different killers and 4 different survivors at release. Now we have 10 killers and 11 survivors! (In case I didnt misscount).The only real negative points I wanna mention here the high rank meta can become a little bit stale but new balance patches and a big variety of different killers definitely helps on that. the community(especially when you get closer to the higher ranks) is pretty toxic. especially the constant \"survivor main vs killer main\" flamewars are annoying. Since we have a so called \"soft ban\" system here in DbD to deal with any kind of misbehaviour it got tremendously better. Before deaththreats cancer wishes and harassment on Steam with group invites were standard whenever you played killer. some flawed game design decisions (but it\\'s getting better!)TL DR this game has a more than fair price. If you are a fan of the survival horror genre just give it a shoot not much you can do wrong with 20$.

Then you will experience the best part about the game...hammering the \"Join a Lobby\" button or waiting for a long time in the \"Create a Lobby\" since the networking system is a total screw up. Most of the people already wrote thatthis game is a \"Failed to Join\" simulator and they are right! So after spending a couple minutes of hammering the \"Join\" button you end up in a lobby with people that played this game already for a couple of days. The game starts and since you are a newcomer you end upto be the first victim. The killer comes near you hits you once so you can\\'t really escape that fast anymore hits you twice and you end up on the ground. Then he carries you to a hook where you get sacrificed. The ground animation and the sacrifice got a possibility to escape but let\\'s be real here...they are just decoration or a good way to destroy your hardware. Hiding in this game is another point that is nearly useless. If you stay too long on one point the damn crows will circle around you and the killer will find you with ease. So compairing the game to other titles will end up in titles like Depth Evolve and any other game that is a competitive simulator with level system where there is a group of low health subjects fighting one high health subject.

       " 'Dead By Daylight is a great game in theory. If you have friends you can have fun playing as survivors or if you have no friends or life you can be a killer. The game involves a lot of grinding. The game is terribly balanced and is immensely stacked in the killers favour. The killers whine to the developers that survivors (particularily survivors who are friends in teamspeak) are overpowered leading to constant buffs for killers. In addition to this killers are usually bad people who will camp your body once you get hooked resulting in you dying before anything even happens in your match. The killers are able to hook you quickly due to cheap \"perks\" such as Iron Grasp Insidious A Nurses Calling and many more. Often the killer won\\'t even hook you but will straight up kill everyone in the first 5 minutes using a \"Mori\" which is a cheap offering people use to kill survivors outright. The idea that survivors are OP in any way shape or form is so laughable it made me uninstall. I did have fun in my over 300 hours playing this game but only against killers who weren\\'t bad people. When you have to leave it up to the nature of the player to determine how others will enjoy the game it\\'s not balanced. If in the future the developers figure out a way to punish killers for camping hooks I may return to the game. I would not recommend the game to people unless you like grinding and getting dicked by unsporting \"killers\".Edit Oh yeah. I forgot to mention there is no way to block or dodge toxic killers in this game. And the BEST PART of DBD is the fact that your save data will spontaneously delete itself. Yeah. You have to manually go into your files and create a back up save file every time you exit the game unless you want your data to be randomly deleted.Edit The new Freddy Kreuger DLC for this game was fun at first but is now mind numbingly unfun and boring. The only counters to Freddy are SWF and pallet looping the two things that were already a problem in the game. On top of that Freddy has cheap add ons where a survivor will literally spawn into the match already in the dream world. The survivor just spawns in and is already being punished with half efficiency action speed AND having their aura visible to the killer. And the Freddy DLC being released on Double Blood points week just ruins it as every match is Freddy and they all want to slug you to death. Want to play Killer? Just have to wait 15 minutes to get a lobby since literally everyone is playing Freddy right now.Edit Killer EditionThis game is literally broken. The Killer is supposed to be the power role but it is actually the survivors that hold the power. Voice communications aren\\'t built into the game and it wasn\\'t balanced around survivors being able to communicate. But using third party software that is exactly what survivors do.One survivor can run the killer around the map using what are known as \"pallet loops\" and \"semi infinites\". Running in circles around pallets and vaulting through windows a survivor can literally run the killer around the entire map while their team is completing generators (all 5 of which can be completed in a matter of minutes if you aren\\'t applying pressure). If they have an OP perk called Decisive Strike they will probably escape again. You may spend an entire match chasing 1 survivor who might escape you and teabag you at the exit gate. Basically to win as a killer at high ranks you rely on survivors making mistakes and that\\'s not something they will do very often unless they are BOOSTED or inebriated. With the current change to the victory system killers must secure a certain numbr of hooks/deaths to rank up although survivors don\\'t have to survive to rank up. If you\\'re gonna play killer in this metagame don\\'t expect to get any kills and if you do you will get harassed called a camper told to kill yourself etc because that is what this community is. The killer isn\\'t feared. If you play killer you are literally submitting yourself for the survivors entertainment at your expense (basically you are a clown). UNLESS you play 1 of 3 killers and you are good with them (Nurse Billy or Huntress) you may stand a chance. All in all the only fun you will get out of this game is playing survivor and trolling the killer. Just remember there is a real human being controlling that killer and they probably aren\\'t having as much fun as you.2 years on and the games progress can STILL randomly delete itself. That means starting over from scratch. Even if you have a backup of your save file and you send it to the devs they are too incompetent to do anything other than refund bloodpoints. If you had a legacy or rare cosmetic skin you are out of luck. Devs are corrupt and give out legacy skins to people they know and close friends like the community manager it\\'s a disgrace.

Later they added a snowy glitched map.Most of killers are camping tunelling &amp it\\'s frustrating to have the match fked up because of this. They sit near the hook until survivor die or if you lay on ground they sit over you so no one else will come to heal you (my suggestion is if more than 5 sec near the hooked player you start lose X points/sec).But same here to devs simply ignore this and they release killers with perks which making camping more \"effective\" and not bannable actually they barely ban anything most useless anti cheat software.Also there is nothing to stop rage disconnecting abuse since in game report system is a bad jocke i played with &amp against the same abusive exploiters players over &amp over again and they continue doing it becase they know that no one take any measures if you dc 3 times out of 5 matches should be insta ban!Plus EAC aka Easy Anti Cheat BS it\\'s 200% useless game is lurking with cheaters/hackers worse than in CS &amp PUBG.

EAC is the worst useless anti cheat ever &amp gives a lot of errors chat is bad (while in lobby) if write in chat then go spectate &amp come back to the lobby you can\\'t see the chat history anymore also ctrl+v/c is not working but even with that the cheaters spam the chat no ping limit! make many matches unplayable when join a poor internet host (even f2p games have options for ping setup limitation e.g. i would like to set mine up to max 150ms so i would play only against those players limit). players that are host (killers) &amp abandon the lobby will send everyone to the start so have to start que again this happens a lot curent achieve increased to 9 consecutive games from which the host abandoned (and no i wasn\\'t in a SWF team) i suggest cooldown/lockdown from que at least 1 hour for whoever disconnect as the lobby hostJust a glimpse of how much this game is broken &amp filled with a toxic community https //clips.twitch.tv/BraveCogentRadicchioPraiseItGame is literally full with cheaters exploiters boosted accounts multiple bans actually does nothing to them if there isnt a permanent one.

       " 'A good game which is absolutely ruined by two factors.1. The game directly encourages people to play like trolls due to the points system. The objective of the game as a victim is not to escape you only gain 5000 points for that. You can get more points if you get chased rescue other survivors from hooks drop pallets on the killer and THEN escape. This leads to victims teabagging the killer to force a chase swarming around hooks to rescue people rather than fixing the generators lurking around pallets instead of fleeing etc. The hook swarming by victims encourages the killer to camp the hook which leads to endless crybaby behaviour after the match from the victims such as insults and false reporting.2. The first point wouldn\\'t be so bad if it weren\\'t for the second. Trash talking and abusive behaviour is part of gamer culture after all. The second (and biggest) problem about the game is the control freak developers. If you look in the forums there are many threads that are locked. There are many users that are banned from posting. The anti cheat system which is a mandatory part of this game results in many false positives but the developers would rather ban nine legitimate users instead of letting one cheater go. On their Twitter accounts (which aren\\'t followed by the vast majority of players) they arbitrarily declare certain playstyles \"cheating\" and threaten to ban people over it because they\\'re not intelligent enough to make those playstyles unbeneficial or impossible through patches. Rather than acknowledging the issues and fixing them the developers just prefer to add a report button so bedwetting victims can report a killer everytime they die.By listening to the most negative hostile voices and obeying their demands the developers have essentially become the game\\'s most salty survivors. This community isn\\'t toxic it\\'s just a normal gamer community that sees abusing the report feature as a way to get a tactical advantage. The developers however are 100% raw sewage because they let the inmates run the asylum. They\\'ll kill the game with their police state attitude. Allowing people to report other users for \"griefing\" is a licence to let them report for literally anything. They shouldn\\'t take such reports seriously but they do.I won\\'t use bots I won\\'t hack and I won\\'t insult other users but I\\'ll play this game however I want regardless of the consequences. I suppose this will lead me to getting banned at some point with a possible VAC ban on my record even though I was playing the game unmodded and perfectly legitimately all because I was facecamping or some other negligible tactic which annoyed developers with zero sense of a proportional response.',\n",

       " 'Even though I have not played that much I am currently Rank 15 in Season Level 24 player and Level 36 Kate Denson Survivor.All I have to say this the community is toxic as hell especially killers towards survivors. This game is so unbalanced in terms of killers versus survivors. And I will begin a list of reasons why Any perk a killer possesses will make their playthrough easier however most survivor perks are totally USELESS. For example Boil Over is totally effing useless where is this 75% struggling effect that helps me escape a killer? I don\\'t see it. And the perks that are useful like Resilience only have a 6 9% increase rate? Really? That small? DEVELOPERS SERIOUSLY?! But look at a killer Perk like Hex holy crap that perk really does damage to a survivor\\'s Skill Check for generators. And you can actually see it. It\\'s not fair. Don\\'t even get me started on the Slipper Meat perk TOTALLY USELESS!! What is the point of having 3 extra chances of getting off a hook if it NEVER works and RARELY works unless you have a \"luck\" offering?! How the hell? There are hooks EVERYWHERE hey devs want to be balanced? Why not put the same amount of hooks as there are generators. There are five generators so put five hooks in the map. Not more than a dozen hooks. Why do killers have second chances but survivors don\\'t? We as survivors have to level up so hard or wait to unlock a perk in the Shrine of Secrets to even get something that can remotely help us. Ready for this developers?* For example look at The Pig this killer can not only hook us but even if we get off the hook she has already attached a trap to our face which we have to get off during a time limit while trying to avoid her. Michael almost makes no sound and shows up unannounced to most survivors. Other killers can teleport become invisible see through closets throw things and have special powers. Why not give survivors special abilities beyond being able to wiggle better escape a grasp (RARELY) hide see things and/or run \"faster\"? The flashlight is mostly useless why not make it so survivors can throw things at killers to stun them? Why not make it easier to break hooks? Why not give survivors \"special powers\"? It is not fair The Hag can teleport in front of a hook if you trying to save some multiple times. It is not fair that if I am saved off a hook and I get re hooked I die? The only negative thing that can happen to a killer is getting stunned. That\\'s it!! There should be more it\\'s not fair they are immortal. I get the concept of the game is avoiding the killer but don\\'t make the killer untouchable. We as survivors get punished if we camp out too long in a closet and have ravens become perched on it so killers know where we are. Why can\\'t killers be punished for camping too long in front of hooks waiting for a player to die? Can\\'t you make the Entity disallow the killer from being around a hook too long? SO UNFAIR!!!It\\'s totally not fair and on top of that the killers have WAY TOO MUCH stamina they are always faster this is not fair.Why are there so many in game hints for a killer to spot a survivor but even when a survivor levels up with a perk like Spine Chill its still completely useless? Killers have ravens generator explosions pain sounds running sounds grunting sounds that notify where survivors are. Whereas survivors can only see each other if the are on the ground or hooked. It\\'s not fair we can\\'t be notified where each other are.So basically this game is really EASY for killers and really HARD for survivors.Peace out devs you guys are horrible.',\n",

I know I\\'m not some \"DbD VeTErEn\" with copious hours to say how the game has changed over time but there\\'s problems that get in the way of making it a great asymetrical multiplayer game. I would only pick this up if you\\'re able to play with friends when playing as a survivor which is the only circumstance that I bought it. From the survivors\\' perspective this game feels just bad for the majority of the time I\\'ve spent on it. Queuing solo is the worst way to play a survivor. There is no way to communicate with other survivors in game with the exception of only two emotes to \"follow me\" and point (so if you play with a novice player there\\'s no kind of direction that you or others can give to them in order to help out the rest of the survivors). Although the experience of getting matched with constantly horrible teammates is from my perspective it seems consistant with what others have said about this game. Killers and their annoyance can vary greatly but the more experienced killer mains popped up than novice killers some of the dlc killers feel more cheap in their abilities especially players that have commited to using them ie pay to win. The largest complaint towards killers are the fact that some player just love camping and there\\'s really no good way of rescueing another player. Sometimes it just feels as if every killer I played against for a time had the most annoying perks on which felt like a constant string of games where I\\'d be killed swiftly regardless if I was playing cautiously. Playing as killers on the other hand feels for the most part fine as in no new player is going to dominate over survivors from the start. It does take time to get decent in order to be a good killer. Playing as killers feels like there\\'s at least some learning curb while survivors on the other hand feel really punished by actions of toxic survivors and killers. There are more than enough times to play as a lone survivor with no generators done because of either incompitent survivors or (mainly) killers that have wiped out anyone that can get enough generators to get a hatch to appear on the map (in these senarios which is easy for killers to patrol undone generators making the task of escaping nil to slim).What really hurts this game is the part of the player base that I\\'ve played with most of them being toxic. I do like how it\\'s a horror movie themed game plus it\\'s a funner experience when playing with friends. You\\'re playing Rainbow Six Siege toxic 2.0 electric horror boogaloo minus a voice and text chat.

In a compitent game if I loose I can change how I play and eventually win at some point because I learned which is an occurance I have never had with this game especially when considering the survivor gameplay. Bad killer a really good chance you\\'ll escape good killer quit the game there\\'s no way to outsmart them because of the game\\'s perk system and killer\\'s abilities.
